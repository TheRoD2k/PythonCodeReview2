# PythonCodeReview2
<h2><b>Second Python code review - Extended Microblog</b></h2>
<h3>Ponomarev Artem, 814</h3>


This is going to be an extended microblog.
For now it can store a simple user base using SQLAlchemy (flask's wrapper) and scrap images for profile from the visible-to-anonymous VK pages (including private pages)
Features right now:
<p>1. Registration using local database (SQLAlchemy)
<p>2. HTML inheritance (jinja2)
<p>3. Web scrapping (Requests + BeautifulSoup)

<h3><b>ToDo list:</b></h3>
<p>1. Add main functionality (scrapping posts from other sites)
<p>2. Optimize image loading (Caching?)
<p>3. Add more functions for the profile page
<p>4. Other functions (Chat?)

I know that is not what I promised to do, but I'm going to use an additional week to finish the project. For now it can work with database and external server, which is, I hope, enough for getting additional time
